# Mendel #

Several implementations of [Mendel's First Law][1] in
Rust. Implementations begin being as bare-bones as possible and
gradually add language features.

## Running ##

First, [install Rust][2]. Then, go in any of the `mendel-nn` folders
and `make`.

To run tests: `make test`

To generate documentation:

    make doc
    open doc/mendel/index.html
